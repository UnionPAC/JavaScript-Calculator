# JS Calculator

For this project in the freeCodeCamp module 'Front End Libraries' I built a calculator using React. The calculator still doesn't 
function the exact same as your normal calculator would. This is mainly due to the specific 'tests' that freeCodeCamp instructed us to pass
with our App. 

This calculator does use Formula/Expression Logic. 
For example: 3 + 5 x 6 - 2 / 4 = 32.5 

Using Immediate Execution Logic the result would have been 11.5... all this refers to is the order of operations, but for regular use Expression Logic
is usually preferred.
